# Unilever-Optimized-Online-Food-Order-and-Delivery-System-CODS-
Comprehensive Business Analysis portfolio project detailing the full life cycle for the Optimized Online Food Order and Delivery System (CODS).
## 📌 **Project Overview**
Unilever, one of the world’s largest FMCG companies with ~1500 employees spread across 12 floors in the UK office, faces serious inefficiencies in its internal canteen operations. Employees waste **30–35 minutes daily** queueing for lunch, leading to productivity loss and dissatisfaction.

This project provides a **complete digital transformation solution**—a web‑based Canteen Ordering & Delivery System. The solution enables pre‑ordering meals before 11 AM, desk delivery, payroll deductions, and automated inventory management.
